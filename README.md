### 📄 About
The Sims 2 is a very... veery... old game (19 years 😯), but it is still a very good videogame. 

Needs a couple of fixes, patches and tweaks for make more enjoyable, and I don't know about you, but don't you think it would be better to have an open source program that you just run, choose what you want to improve for your game and play? well, I do.

### 📦 Features
 - Support for newer resolutions HD / QHD / UHD and 16:9. (So far from 800x600 🤮)
 - The Sims 2 Fast-Launcher, for those with little pacience.
 - Tons of lightweight mods for fixing & tweaking bugs, glitches, and the much feared ***corruption***. (?)
